## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to insert an icon to the tab heading of a page. Details below:
```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="./images/favicon-32x32.png">
```
Also learnt how to add a font-type that may not necessarily be in your local device to your css file. Details below:
```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Outfit';
    src: url(https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit);
}
```

### Continued development

- Getting better in CSS positing and Grid frameworks
- Semantic HTML
